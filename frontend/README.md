## Getting Started

Download or clone the repository on github. Then, make sure to install
all dependencies by running "yarn install" in the /frontend directory.

In order to connect the frontend to your backend, go to the next.config.js file.
Then, change the env backendUrl variable to your backend's url.

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
