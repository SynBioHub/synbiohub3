# How to run
 - Startup the virtuoso server on the default port.
 - unzip the data.zip so that it is in a folder called out next to the upload.js folder (make sure you dont have a data folder inside)
 - run `node upload.js` (assuming you already installed nodejs)
 - wait for it to upload
 - then check with the frontend to see the data
