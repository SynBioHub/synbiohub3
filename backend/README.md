Prerequisites: Install Maven (or use IntelliJ which has Spring Boot support)

To build a JAR file using maven, navigate to the ``backend`` directory and run

``mvn package``

and run the JAR file with


``java -jar target/{name of JAR}``



If you're using IntelliJ, right click the ``pom.xml`` file and import all dependencies, then run the project.
